A complete events manager for wordpress using the post type api, completely flexible, customizable and using the great jQuery plugin Full Calendar (http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/), that means that you have a great events management with a rich interface for your blog and/or site users.

== Description ==

Once installed, it will be possible create a event in a section called "Agenda". You will see a page like your seeing any post. But with this plugin, you will save information about start date, end date and about hours that start and ends. I hope I can make a integration with facebook later!

Well, you can have a fully customizable template just adding a agenda.php file as the main template, and then just insert this markup to make it works:

<div id="wp-agenda-calendar"></div>

This is the plugin features and that makes different of other ones around:

* Making a event manager of a wordpress way, the right way, using post-type to have fully customization.
* A rich UI for the calendar
* Easy event manager, with all the post features, as featured image
