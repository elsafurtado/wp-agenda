A complete events manager for wordpress using the post type api, completely flexible with rich UI.

== Description ==

Once installed, it will be possible create a event in a section called "Agenda". You will see a page like your seeing any post. But with this plugin, you will save information about start date, end date and about hours that start and ends. I hope I can make a integration with facebook later!

Thanks for [Full Calendar](http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/ "Full Calendar") for the great plugin!

Well, you can have a fully customizable template just adding a agenda.php file as the main template, and then just insert this markup to make it works:

<div id="wp-agenda-calendar"></div>

Now you can access the calendar at http://yourwordpresspage/?agenda

You can create a menu widget with the above link to calendar, but you can use as you prefer.

This is the plugin features and that makes different of other ones around:

* Making a event manager of a wordpress way, the right way, using post-type to have fully customization.
* A rich UI for the calendar
* Easy event manager, with all the post features, as featured image

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

Another way is access the github page and make a download: http://github.com/alexanmtz/wp-agenda

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's the different from others great Agenda Plugins out there? =

Well, my motivation to write this plugin is to use the new post-type introduced at version 3.0. This way I could use the wordpress post system to handler events as posts, and this way be categorized and treated as posts. Another thing is that I was wishing some flexible with the layout, so you can use a agenda template in your theme and it will be loaded!.
